Before we talk about programming skills, let' s think about a question: what you think is the most important thing for software developer?

Experience? new ideas? NO! Health body decides how long you can keep producing the code, or in another word, how long your career is.

Specially for the software programmer, most of them have to sit in the chair and watch the monitor for a long time everyday. To avoid the occupational disease such as Cervical spondylosis, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, all the doctor's advice is making pause and workout. On the other hand, when you focus on the work and try your best to solve the problem, you may ignore this advice. In the course of time, some kind of occupational disease will come to you.

From my experience, choosing a proper or ergonomic equipment could help a lot. I've also read many reviews of hardware like chairs monitor, desks, keyboards etc. Some of them are really expensive. Is it worth to buy all of them? I don't think so. I will show my personal shopping or wish list, on which includes the most helpful tools.

> - **Ergonomic Mouse**

As a programmer, mouse is so important that we use it very frequently everyday. When I work in Conti, I needed to write, maintain and debug the code. One day, I felt that my wrist hurt and this situation went worse. I realized that I should make a break. A few days later I went to the Media Market to buy battery . When I stand at the shelf, which all the mouses were put on, I saw an ergonomic mouse made by Logitech -- Logitech MX Vertical. It looked so different that i searched the product information immediately. After reading all the reviews, I decided to buy it. I have to say that it help me a lot and wrist didn't hurt. I recommended it to my other friends later and received positive feedback.

> - **Wrist Rest Pad**

Maybe for a programmer, a mechanic keyboard is just like a sword for a soldier. Many programmers would like to choose a mechanic keyboard with cherry blue switch. However, some mechanic keyboard doesn't have a wrist rest pad. The height of mechanic keyboard is more than 2cm. If you use the mechanic keyboard without wrist rest pad, after typing for a long time, your wrist will feel very unconformable. SO, if you don't have a wrist rest pad, I suggest you buy one. I use the wrist rest pad produced by Kingston Hyper X.
