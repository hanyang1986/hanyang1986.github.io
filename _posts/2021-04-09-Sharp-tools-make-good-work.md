Before we talk about programming skills, let' s think about a question: what you think is the most important thing for software developer?

Experience? new ideas? NO! Health body decides how long you can keep producing the code, or in another word, how long your career is.

Specially for the software programmer, most of them have to sit in the chair and watch the monitor for a long time everyday. To avoid the occupational disease such as Cervical spondylosis, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, all the doctor's advice is making pause and workout. On the other hand, when you focus on the work and try your best to solve the problem, you may ignore this advice. In the course of time, some kind of occupational disease will come to you.

From my experience, choosing a proper or ergonomic desktop could help a lot. I've also read many reviews of hardware like chairs monitor, desks, keyboards etc. Some of them are really expensive. Is it worth to buy all of them? I don't think so. I will show my personal shopping or wish list, on which includes the most helpful tools.
